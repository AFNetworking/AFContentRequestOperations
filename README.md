# AFNetworking Content Request Operations

These classes are the original content-specific `AFHTTPRequestOperation` subclasses from the older releases of AFNetworking, re-implemented using the AFNetworking 2.0 APIs. These are provided for compatibility reasons. New projects are encouraged to take advantage of the new serializer-based approach of 2.0.

## Request Operation Classes

- `AFJSONRequestOperation`
- `AFXMLRequestOperation`
- `AFPropertyListRequestOperation`
- `AFImageRequestOperation`
